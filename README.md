# 🏥 AI-Based Patient Monitoring System

An AI-assisted patient monitoring system that simulates real-time vital signs, detects critical health anomalies, provides dynamic precautionary guidance, visualizes data live, and sends automated SMS alerts to doctors.

This project demonstrates how AI, data analytics, and automation can be used to improve healthcare monitoring systems.
